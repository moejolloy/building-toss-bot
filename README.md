There is plenty of recent evidence supporting the theory that, in cricket, in many situations, most prevalently in the UAE or subcontinent where dew is a factor in the second innings, winning the toss gives the toss-winning team a significant statistical advantage. 

Many great games are a balance between luck and skill. This evidence shows that the toss has, in some circumstances, tipped the balance too far towards luck for this bot-maker's liking.

So, this bot evangelically heads to r/Cricket and gently nudges those who mention 'the toss' with some evidence for this theory.

The dream, comrades, is of a fairer method of toss-making. There are a few theories floating around on this subject. One of the goals of this botmonger is to build a predictive model for providing a cricket captain with a possible 'bid' for the toss in penalty runs. A bigger project, for another day.

Yours,lllll
